        <!-- Full Script -->
        <pre>
<strong>INT. CYBER-LAIR â€“ NIGHT</strong>

(Kamau sits at a dimly lit table, surrounded by flickering monitors displaying streams of code and hacking tools. Heâ€™s intense, in the zone. Drexx strolls in, casual, carrying a blunt.)

<strong>DREXX</strong>  
(Smiling)  
"Yo, Kamau! Relax kidogo, man. Unafikiri uta-crash hiyo system ukiwa na kichwa moto hivyo?"

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Dead serious, without looking up)  
"Drexx, tuna deal na watu wenye hawana huruma. Lazima hii heist ikuwe perfect."

<strong>DREXX</strong>  
(Teasing)  
"Bro, si lazima uwe stiff kama ka router? Mi nataka tu niwe sure hauta crash usiku wa leo."

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Walking in, with an air of confidence)  
"Macho yote kwa Phantom King. Sasa, si muache kungâ€™angâ€™ana? Game iko na wewe, Kamau."

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(With a sharp look)  
"Si najua mimi ni King, lakini hii ni zaidi ya vibe, Zuri. Ni maisha yetu iko kwa line."

<strong>SHANI</strong>  
(Leaning in with a sly grin)  
"Ningependa kujua ni lini tutaanza kutumia hizo mamilioni."

---

<strong>INT. CYBER-LAIR â€“ LATER</strong>  

(The crew gathers around Kamau as he begins explaining the plan, highlighting key locations and encrypted routes on the monitors.)

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
"We access Bullâ€™s system through his weakest link â€“ his office network. Drexx, uta handle entry na distractions. Shani, utawezesha exit strategy. Na Zuriâ€¦ youâ€™ll be the bait."

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(With a smirk)  
"Unafikiria hii ni mara yangu ya kwanza?"

<strong>DREXX</strong>  
(Laughing)  
"Huyu ndio sniper wa mapenzi na schemes. Bull hatajua alichoingilia."

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Looking at Zuri)  
"Usicheze na hii. Bull ni hatari. Ana kila resource ya kutumaliza."

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Deadly calm)  
"Sina woga, Kamau. Na najua unavyonihitaji kufanikisha hii heist."

---

<strong>INT. OFFICE BUILDING â€“ NIGHT</strong>  

(The heist is underway. Zuri struts into the building, wearing a sleek outfit, distracting security with her charm and allure. Drexx takes out his laptop, pulling up the security feed.)

<strong>DREXX</strong>  
(Through earpiece)  
"Clearance granted, Phantom King. Naona mapango ya security yote kwa screen."

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Focused, typing furiously)  
"Good. Ni-time ya kuingia na kuchota hizo files."

<strong>SHANI</strong>  
(Breathless, on lookout)  
"Kama bullâ€™s crew wakuja, tumeisha."

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Through the earpiece, voice low and teasing)  
"Relax. Kama kuna mtu atanasa, haitakuwa sisi."

---

<strong>INT. SERVER ROOM â€“ MOMENTS LATER</strong>  

(Kamau locates the servers, connecting his USB device to pull sensitive data. Suddenly, an alarm goes off. **Red lights flash**, filling the room with tension.)

<strong>DREXX</strong>  
"Piga kazi haraka, Kamau. Kuna squad inakuja hiyo direction!"

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Typing faster)  
"Almost done. Zuri, prep for extraction!"

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Calmly, looking at herself in the mirror)  
"Niko ready."

---

<strong>INT. BUILDING EXIT â€“ MOMENTS LATER</strong>  

(The crew races out, alarms blaring, narrowly escaping Bullâ€™s reinforcements. They dash down the stairwell, out into the alleyway where their getaway car is waiting. Shani drives, tires screeching as they make a break for it.)

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Breathless, holding tightly to the stolen data)  
"Tulipona kidogo. Lakini tutarudi kwa Bull. Ni game ya vita sasa."

<strong>SHANI</strong>  
(Laughing wildly as she swerves through Nairobiâ€™s streets)  
"Najua Kamau hakubali kushindwa. Kwanza kama ina involve pesa na revenge."

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Looking at Kamau with a smirk)  
"Yaani nilijua siku moja nitakuja kukuumiza moyo kidogo, King."

<strong>FADE OUT.</strong>
