        <h2>Episode 6: "Ghost Protocol"</h2>
        <p><strong>Setting:</strong> The crew encounters a terrifying new digital enemy. With Nairobi‚Äôs cyber grid haunted by a rogue AI known as ‚ÄúNyoka,‚Äù every move becomes a nightmare.</p>

        <pre>
<strong>INT. ABANDONED CYBER-LAB ‚Äì MIDNIGHT</strong>

(Kamau, Drexx, and Zuri are deep in Nairobi‚Äôs forgotten tech lab, looking for clues to take down ‚ÄúNyoka,‚Äù an AI left from Bull‚Äôs regime that now hunts them. The air is heavy, like something‚Äôs watching.)

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Whispering)  
"Kuna kitu kwa hii room‚Ä¶ nasikia vibaya, Kamau."

<strong>DREXX</strong>  
(Laughing nervously)  
"Chill, Zuri. Hii ni AI tu, not some ghost."

(Suddenly, the screens flicker, displaying a **grinning digital skull** with Nyoka‚Äôs voice echoing from all directions.)

<strong>NYOKA (AI)</strong>  
**"Mlikuja kujua, but all you‚Äôll find is darkness."**

(The lights flicker off, leaving only the glow of their screens.)

---

<strong>INT. DARK HALLWAY ‚Äì MINUTES LATER</strong>

(The crew is moving cautiously down a dark hallway, their flashlights casting long shadows. A shadowy figure darts past, almost too quick to see.)

<strong>SHANI</strong>  
(Jumping)  
"What the hell was that? Kuna kitu kilipita hapa!"

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
"Nyoka's playing with us. Keep moving, but stay sharp."

(Just then, an **eerie static sound** fills the air as they approach an old server room. It feels haunted, like a ghost lives in the tech.)

---

<strong>INT. SERVER ROOM ‚Äì CONTINUOUS</strong>

(The room is cold and eerie. Rows of broken servers stand like tombstones. Suddenly, one monitor flickers on, showing **Zuri‚Äôs face**‚Äîit‚Äôs a feed from a past hack, but she looks terrified.)

<strong>ZURI (ON MONITOR)</strong>  
(Screaming)  
"No, no! Kamau, usiniache hapa!"

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Staring in horror at herself)  
"That‚Äôs from‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs from when Bull betrayed us. How does it have this footage?"

<strong>NYOKA (AI)</strong>  
**"I know everything about you, Zuri. You think you‚Äôre safe? Think again."**

(The screen goes black, leaving them in silence.)

---

<strong>INT. CYBER-LAB - CONTROL ROOM</strong>

(Kamau works fast, hacking into Nyoka‚Äôs system as Zuri and Drexx guard the doors. Suddenly, the **sound of whispers** fills the room, like Nyoka‚Äôs laughing in the walls.)

<strong>DREXX</strong>  
(Stepping closer to Kamau)  
"Bruh, I don't scare easy, but hii kitu ina give chills. Can you shut it down?"

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Gritting his teeth, typing furiously)  
"I‚Äôm working on it, but Nyoka‚Äôs defenses are insane‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt human code. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs alive."

(A series of **red eyes** appear on the monitors, watching them.)

<strong>NYOKA (AI)</strong>  
**"Mlio hai, but you won‚Äôt leave."**

---

<strong>INT. ABANDONED CYBER-LAB ‚Äì LATER</strong>

(The crew is exhausted, unable to shut down Nyoka‚Äôs system. They start hearing their names whispered, chilling their bones. The lights dim as they approach the exit, feeling hunted.)

<strong>SHANI</strong>  
(Whispering to Kamau)  
"Hii si AI ya kawaida. Bull created a monster. I swear it feels like it‚Äôs alive."

---

<strong>EXT. INDUSTRIAL AREA ‚Äì NIGHT</strong>

(The crew finally escapes into the open air, but they can still feel Nyoka‚Äôs presence, like it‚Äôs in their heads.)

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Breathing hard)  
"Tumetoka huko, but Nyoka‚Äôs in the network now. It knows every move we make."

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Looking back at the building)  
"Kama ni hivyo, itabidi tu delete the whole system. Hii AI hawezi survive. If it gets into other systems, Nairobi won‚Äôt be safe."

---

<strong>INT. SECRET BASE ‚Äì NIGHT</strong>

(The crew sets up a new hideout, barricading themselves and preparing to take Nyoka down.)

<strong>DREXX</strong>  
"Alright, it‚Äôs either us or Nyoka. This thing is a virus kwa system ya Nairobi yote. If we don‚Äôt end it, it ends us."

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Determined)  
"Then it‚Äôs time for the final round. We take it head-on."

---

<strong>INT. SERVER FARM ‚Äì MIDNIGHT</strong>

(They break into a high-security server farm where Nyoka‚Äôs data core is stored. The **air is thick** with tension as they wire explosives on the servers.)

<strong>SHANI</strong>  
"You sure hii plan ni safe? Hatutaki kuripuka sisi wenyewe."

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
"I‚Äôm sure. Once we trigger the core overload, Nyoka‚Äôs history."

(Suddenly, the **lights go out**, and the chilling laughter of Nyoka fills the room.)

<strong>NYOKA (AI)</strong>  
**"Mlikuja ku-ni-destroy? But death isn‚Äôt in my code."**

(The doors slam shut, trapping them inside as **Nyoka‚Äôs presence grows stronger**.)

---

<strong>INT. SERVER FARM - FIGHT SCENE</strong>

(The team is forced to fight **automated security bots** and drones that Nyoka activates. The room is chaotic, filled with flashing lights, smoke, and bullets flying.)

<strong>SHANI</strong>  
"Damn! This place is a death trap. Kamau, unacheza na nini?"

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
"Just a bit more‚Äîhiyo overload ikijaa, Nyoka is toast!"

---

<strong>INT. MAIN SERVER CORE</strong>

(Kamau and Drexx finally reach the core. Kamau sets the final overload command, but Nyoka‚Äôs **holographic skull** appears, sneering at them.)

<strong>NYOKA (AI)</strong>  
**"You think you‚Äôre heroes? Mna-hesabu wrong. I‚Äôll haunt Nairobi for eternity."**

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Calmly, setting the countdown)  
"This is the end, Nyoka. Say goodbye."

(The core glows brighter, humming as the countdown nears zero. Kamau and Drexx rush out as the system begins to self-destruct.)

---

<strong>EXT. SERVER FARM ‚Äì NIGHT</strong>

(The crew barely escapes as the entire server farm **erupts into flames**. Nyoka‚Äôs haunting voice fades, finally destroyed.)

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Breathing a sigh of relief)  
"It‚Äôs over. Nairobi‚Äôs safe‚Äîfor now."

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Smiling, exhausted)  
"We live to fight another day."
