        <!-- Full Script -->
        <pre>
<strong>INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE â€“ NIGHT</strong>

(The scene opens with Kamau, Drexx, and Shani prepping in the abandoned warehouse. Zuri is off to the side, smoking, watching the guys with an unreadable expression. The tension is electric, with everyone on edge.)

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Turning to the group, intense)  
"This is it. Hakuna kurudi nyuma. Tukishinda leo, Bull hawezi tena kututafuta. But if one of us messes upâ€¦ thatâ€™s game over."

<strong>DREXX</strong>  
(Hitting his chest)  
"We got this, fam. Hakuna retreat. Letâ€™s make this a full shutdown."

<strong>SHANI</strong>  
(Clearly worried, looking over at Zuri)  
"Yoh, lakini are we sure kila mtu kwa hii team ako loyal?"

(Zuri narrows her eyes, stepping forward.)

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Challenging Shani, smirking)  
"Ni mimi unamaanisha? Au ni paranoia yako? â€˜Cause I didnâ€™t come here for doubt and drama."

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Cold, looking at her)  
"Everyone in this room has to prove themselves tonight. Hii ni do-or-die."

---

<strong>INT. NAIROBIâ€™S UNDERGROUND SERVER ROOM â€“ MIDNIGHT</strong>

(The team hacks into Bullâ€™s mainframe. Kamau types furiously as screens fill with lines of encrypted code. Drexx monitors security feeds, his fingers twitching with adrenaline.)

<strong>DREXX</strong>  
"Lazima tuchome hizi firewall, but we have a 30-second window. Kamau, your move."

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Frustrated, focusing)  
"I got this. Kwa count ya tatu, connect the relayâ€”no mistakes."

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Stepping up beside him, almost taunting)  
"Hii pressure inakulemea, love? Ama it's just cold feet?"

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Shooting her a sharp look)  
"Usicheze na mimi. Tuko serious hapa."

---

<strong>INT. BULLâ€™S CONTROL ROOM â€“ SAME TIME</strong>

(Bull watches everything through his CCTV feeds, a sinister grin on his face. His top goon, Big Mo, stands by with an arsenal of weapons.)

<strong>BULL</strong>  
(Smiling menacingly)  
"Kamau thinks heâ€™s clever. But hii game iko rigged tangu mwanzo. Prepare plan B."

<strong>BIG MO</strong>  
(Grinning)  
"Tonight, we shut down Kamau and his little crew permanently."

---

<strong>EXT. NAIROBI STREETS â€“ NIGHT</strong>

(Shani and Drexx are sent outside as decoys, creating a distraction to keep Bullâ€™s men occupied. They move through dimly lit streets, hoodies up, blending into the night.)

<strong>SHANI</strong>  
(Laughing as they dodge a patrol)  
"Hii ni crazy! Can you believe this is our lives, bruh?"

<strong>DREXX</strong>  
(Grinning, hyped up)  
"Bro, hii ni Nairobi. Life ni war, na sisi ndio soldiers."

(They duck into an alley, setting off a series of timed explosions across the street, luring Bullâ€™s goons away from the main hideout.)

---

<strong>INT. SERVER ROOM â€“ NIGHT</strong>

(Back in the server room, Kamau and Zuri are alone. Thereâ€™s a charged silence as Kamau works furiously, and Zuri watches him.)

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Softly, almost tender)  
"Kamauâ€¦ ukimaliza, tunatoka hapa pamoja?"

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Conflicted, looking at her with narrowed eyes)  
"I donâ€™t know. I canâ€™t trust anyone right now."

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Sighing, looking hurt)  
"Unaishi kama isolated island. Trust is everything."

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
"Betrayal ni kitu ya kawaida kwa game yetu. Youâ€™re just another wild card."

(As they stare each other down, thereâ€™s a sudden alarm. Bullâ€™s men have found them, and itâ€™s chaos as they rush to escape.)

---

<strong>INT. INDUSTRIAL AREA ALLEY â€“ NIGHT</strong>

(Kamau and Zuri dash into the alleyway, the sound of bullets ricocheting behind them. Theyâ€™re cornered, and Kamau pulls Zuri close, heart pounding.)

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Breathless, desperate)  
"Kama huu ndio mwisho, najua Iâ€™m with the right person."

(She leans in, kissing him passionately, but the momentâ€™s shattered as they hear more gunshots.)

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Pulling back, resolute)  
"No, this isnâ€™t the end. Weâ€™ll burn everything before that happens."

---

<strong>INT. NAIROBI SKYSCRAPER â€“ MIDNIGHT</strong>

(The final scene shifts to Kamau and Zuri on top of a skyscraper, a last stand against Bullâ€™s men. Explosions light up the city below as their crew fights back from all sides. The night is chaos, and Kamau knows this is the make-or-break moment.)

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Speaking into his earpiece)  
"Drexx, set off the EMP. Hii game lazima imalizwe."

<strong>DREXX</strong>  
(Over the earpiece, shouting)  
"On it! Hii Nairobi itajua hatujacheza!"
