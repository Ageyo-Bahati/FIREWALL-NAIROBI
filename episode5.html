        <h2>Episode 5: "Into the Fire"</h2>
        <p><strong>Setting:</strong> The crewâ€™s trapped between enemies and betrayal, and itâ€™s an all-out battle for survival. With Bullâ€™s forces closing in, Kamauâ€™s ready to go to any length for revenge.</p>

        <pre>
<strong>EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE â€“ NIGHT</strong>

(The warehouse is filled with shadows. Kamau, Drexx, and Shani hide among broken machinery, guns drawn, as the sound of footsteps echo from all directions. **Bull's hitmen** have them surrounded.)

<strong>DREXX</strong>  
(Whispering)  
"Tulikuwa na plan gani ya kutoka kwa hii mess? Tumekaliwa kisawa kisawa."

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Focused, loading his gun)  
"We fight our way out. Hii lazima tuwashinde na ku-escape. Tukikufa leo, ni lazima tuwaibishe."

<strong>SHANI</strong>  
(Smirking)  
"Let's give 'em a real show, basi."

---

<strong>INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE â€“ CONTINUOUS</strong>

(As the hitmen close in, Kamau signals Drexx. They ambush from behind a stack of crates, opening fire. The scene is intense, with bullets flying and the sound of metal clanging. Kamau moves with sharp focus, taking down enemies one by one.)

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Yelling to Drexx)  
"Toka huko na uzime their signals! Theyâ€™re calling for backup."

<strong>DREXX</strong>  
(Frantically typing on a mini device)  
"Niko nayo, niko nayo. Three secondsâ€¦ done!"

(A nearby comm device goes silent as Drexx successfully cuts off the enemyâ€™s signal.)

---

<strong>EXT. ROOFTOP ABOVE WAREHOUSE â€“ SAME TIME</strong>

(Zuri watches the chaos unfold below, a faint smirk on her lips as she observes the **crew fighting for their lives**. Her phone rings.)

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Speaking into the phone)  
"Yeah, they're busy, but they won't make it. Kamau thinks he's invincible, but he's just a pawn."

<strong>VOICE ON PHONE</strong>  
"Make sure it happens tonight. Bull wants no survivors."

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
"Consider it done."

(She hangs up, her eyes glinting with malice. She walks away, disappearing into the night.)

---

<strong>INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE â€“ MAIN FLOOR</strong>

(The gunfight continues. Kamau notices **an explosive device** hidden on one of the crates.)

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(To Drexx, panicking)  
"Yo! Kuna bomb hapa! Get everyone out, sasa hivi!"

<strong>DREXX</strong>  
"Ah, lazima tuharakishe basi!"

(The crew sprints toward the exit as a loud **beeping** sound fills the warehouse. Just as they reach the door, the bomb goes off, sending them flying.)

---

<strong>EXT. WAREHOUSE ALLEY â€“ NIGHT</strong>

(The crew is disoriented, bruised but alive. Kamau pulls Drexx to his feet as Shani looks around for any signs of pursuit.)

<strong>SHANI</strong>  
(Coughing, covered in dust)  
"Tumetoka kwa hiyo trap lakini tuko mbali sana na salama."

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Breathing heavily)  
"Tumefika mwisho hapa. Itâ€™s time to bring the fight straight to Bull."

---

<strong>INT. BULL'S HIDEOUT â€“ LATER THAT NIGHT</strong>

(Bull is lounging in a leather chair, sipping whiskey. Heâ€™s surrounded by monitors showing surveillance footage of Nairobi. Suddenly, Kamauâ€™s face appears on one of the screens.)

<strong>BULL</strong>  
(Amused)  
"Look who survived. That cockroach always finds a way back."

<strong>KAMAU (on screen)</strong>  
"Iâ€™m coming for you, Bull. Hii ni personal sasa. And when Iâ€™m done, uta-wish you never crossed me."

(Bull chuckles, unfazed.)

<strong>BULL</strong>  
"Bring it, kid. Youâ€™re not ready for this game."

---

<strong>INT. CYBER-LAIR â€“ NIGHT</strong>

(Back in the lair, the crew regroups. Drexx is working furiously on his laptop, hacking into Bullâ€™s system.)

<strong>SHANI</strong>  
"Uko serious about hii revenge, ama ni emotions tu zinakupeleka?"

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Matter-of-fact)  
"This is war now. Hii si mambo ya loyalty. Ni blood for blood."

---

<strong>INT. ABANDONED BUILDING â€“ NEXT DAY</strong>

(The crew infiltrates one of Bullâ€™s safehouses. Kamau moves stealthily, taking out guards one by one. **Action-packed fight scenes** ensue, with Kamau and Drexx using everything from guns to hand-to-hand combat. Itâ€™s brutal, raw, and nasty.)

<strong>GUARD</strong>  
(Screaming as Kamau punches him)  
"Aah! Tafadhali, I didnâ€™t know it was you guys!"

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Coldly)  
"You chose the wrong side, brother."

(He knocks the guard out, moving on to the next.)

---

<strong>INT. FINAL ROOM OF SAFEHOUSE</strong>

(The crew corners Bull, whoâ€™s finally defenseless. Kamau steps forward, gun drawn, as Bull smirks, unafraid.)

<strong>BULL</strong>  
"You really think youâ€™re the hero here, Kamau? Heroes die in this world."

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
"Iâ€™m not here to be a hero. Iâ€™m here to end you."

(Kamau raises the gun, his finger on the trigger. Bull lunges at him in a last attempt, and the two get into a brutal struggle. Finally, Kamau overpowers him and stands over Bull.)

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
"This is for everyone you betrayed."

(He fires, ending Bull.)

---

<strong>EXT. ROOFTOP â€“ NIGHT</strong>

(The crew stands on a rooftop, looking over Nairobiâ€™s skyline, finally free from Bullâ€™s hold. The night is quiet, but tension lingers as they contemplate what comes next.)

<strong>DREXX</strong>  
(Grinning)  
"So, what now? Another heist? More chaos?"

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Smiling slightly)  
"Firstâ€¦ a drink. Then, we rebuild."
