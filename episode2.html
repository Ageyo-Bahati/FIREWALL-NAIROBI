        <h2>Episode 2: "Smokescreens"</h2>

        <!-- Full Script -->
        <pre>
<strong>INT. CYBER-LAIR â€“ NIGHT</strong>

(Kamauâ€™s lair is filled with smoke and neon light. Kamau stares at his screen, visibly disturbed by the data heâ€™s uncovered. Zuri is sprawled on a couch, watching him closely.)

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Sultry, slightly taunting)  
"Hii vibe yako ya paranoid itaku-cost, boo. Ama unafikiria ni mimi nimekutenga?"  

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Cynical, barely looking up)  
"I donâ€™t trust anyone at this point. You... ni red flag from day one."  

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Leaning in, seductive, her hand on his shoulder)  
"Red flag? But najua ni hiyo thrill unakimbilia. Mi na wewe ni kama fire na gasoline."

(She runs her hand down his arm, and Kamau finally meets her gaze. Thereâ€™s a moment, intense and heavy with tension.)

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Sighing, almost giving in)  
"Acha kucheza na fire. Najua kuna kitu hujaniambia."

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Whispers in his ear)  
"Some secrets are meant to be kept, babe. Na si kila kitu ni black and white."

---

<strong>INT. BULL'S LAIR â€“ NIGHT</strong>

(Bull is in a dimly lit office, surrounded by monitors showing Kamauâ€™s recent activity. He smirks, his finger tapping rhythmically as his top thug, **Big Mo**, reports.)

<strong>BULL</strong>  
"Kamau ana-cheza sana, but naona ana-open weaknesses. We move tomorrow usiku, bila kuhesabu hasara."

<strong>BIG MO</strong>  
"Yes boss. Lakini huyu dem wakeâ€¦ Zuri, sheâ€™s playing a double game pia."

(Bull laughs, almost admiringly.)

<strong>BULL</strong>  
"Kila mtu ana-think theyâ€™re a king or queen kwa hii game. Little do they know, weâ€™re all pawns."

---

<strong>INT. KAMAUâ€™S APARTMENT â€“ LATER</strong>

(Zuri and Kamau have retreated to his apartment after a heated argument. They sit on the couch in tense silence, then Zuri pulls Kamau closer.)

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Half-smiling)  
"Kama uko na doubts, niambie. But usicheze ka mtoto. Wewe na mimi ni same blood."

(Kamau canâ€™t resist anymore. He pulls her in, their lips meeting in a passionate kiss. The scene grows intense, full of tension as they move toward the bedroom. Just before things escalate, Kamau stops.)

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Breathing heavily)  
"Mimi si mjinga. Na ukinibetray, utajuta."  

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Smirking, whispering)  
"Baby, si umeshajua mimi ni poison, na bado unataka tu. Tuendelee tu kucheza."

---

<strong>INT. CYBER-LAIR â€“ NEXT DAY</strong>  

(The crew is gathered again, plotting their next move against Bull. Drexx is hyped, as usual, while Shani seems uneasy.)

<strong>SHANI</strong>  
(Skeptical)  
"Tunadeal na Bull na his goonsâ€¦ do we have an exit plan ama tunasikiza tu hizi lovebird na red flags zao?"

<strong>DREXX</strong>  
(Laughing)  
"Nimechoka, bruh. Let the toxic crew handle it. Just point me to the cash flow."

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Firm)  
"Hii ni mission ya kuua Bull once and for all. Hakuna mchezo."

<strong>MIKHAILA</strong>  
(Grinning, excited)  
"Ni-time ya ku-burn Nairobi down. Ready, ama uko na cold feet?"

---

<strong>INT. BULL'S WAREHOUSE â€“ NIGHT</strong>

(The crew sneaks into Bullâ€™s warehouse. Itâ€™s dark, high-stakes, and tension is at its peak. Theyâ€™re communicating in whispers through their earpieces.)

<strong>SHANI</strong>  
"Kamau, iko clear hapa. Mikhaila, distract guards wa east wing. Hii ni chance yetu."

<strong>MIKHAILA</strong>  
"Roger that. Lakini tukipona hii, mi nataka hiyo promised date na discount on top."

<strong>SHANI</strong>  
(Smirking)  
"Hauna woga. Tuko sawa."

---

<strong>INT. WAREHOUSE OFFICE â€“ MOMENTS LATER</strong>  

(Kamau finally comes face-to-face with Bull. Zuri stands at Kamauâ€™s side, tense, as Bull grins confidently.)

<strong>BULL</strong>  
(Chillingly calm)  
"Kamauâ€¦ you got balls. But uko ndani ya jungle, na mimi ndio simba."

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Smirking back)  
"Simba? Hii jungle tutachoma. Youâ€™re done, Bull."

(They stare each other down before a gunshot rings out. Itâ€™s chaos. Zuri grabs Kamau, pulling him into a side hallway as Drexx and Shani take out the guards.)

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Breathless, whispering)  
"Tulipeana warning. Sasa tunasurvive ama tunachoma kila kitu."

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Determined)  
"We finish this tonight."

<strong>FADE OUT.</strong>
