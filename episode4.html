        <h2>Episode 4: "The Betrayal"</h2>
        <p><strong>Setting:</strong> Tensions run high as secrets unfold, alliances crack, and an unexpected betrayal puts Kamauâ€™s crew in the line of fire.</p>

        <pre>
<strong>INT. CYBER-LAIR â€“ NIGHT</strong>

(Kamau, Drexx, Shani, and Zuri gather around the main screens. The room is heavy with tension after a failed heist the previous night. Kamau is pacing, visibly furious.)

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
"Someone sold us out. Hii plan haingekuwa flop unless kuna traitor hapa ndani."

<strong>DREXX</strong>  
(Defensive)  
"Bruh, siwezi kuwa mimi. Si unaona everything Iâ€™ve done for the crew?"

<strong>SHANI</strong>  
(Shooting a glare at Zuri)  
"Na wewe, missy, una-trust issues sana. Kuna kitu unatuficha?"

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Smirking, crossing her arms)  
"Si mimi ndio mnadhani nawasaliti? Fine, then, kaeni mkifanya drama, mtaona."

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Stepping closer to Zuri, almost daring her)  
"Youâ€™re hiding something. Na usipodrop hiyo secret, youâ€™re out."

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Leaning in, taunting)  
"Kamau, uko blinded na trust issues zako. Maybe hiyo ndiyo inakufanya kuwa weak."

---

<strong>INT. NAIROBI BACKSTREET â€“ MIDNIGHT</strong>

(Kamau storms out of the lair, his phone buzzing. A text from an unknown number appears: "You want answers? Meet me in the backstreet behind The Hive Club.")

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Muttering to himself)  
"This better not be another setup."

(He slips into the shadows of Nairobiâ€™s backstreets, keeping an eye on every corner. Suddenly, **Zuri appears**, stepping out of the darkness with a sly smile.)

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
"I knew youâ€™d come. Hii ndo proof, Kamau. Someone else is playing us all."

(She hands him a flash drive and leans in close, whispering.)

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
"Use this. Na remember, trust is dead in this game."

---

<strong>INT. CYBER-LAIR â€“ LATER THAT NIGHT</strong>

(Kamau plugs in the flash drive back at the lair. Drexx, Shani, and the rest of the crew watch as encrypted files flood the screen.)

<strong>DREXX</strong>  
"Yo, hizi files ni hardcore. Hawa watu wako steps ahead of us."

<strong>SHANI</strong>  
(Whispering, almost scared)  
"Na kama Zuri yuko involved kwa hii betrayal?"

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Pulling out a gun, tense)  
"Kama hii drive ni trap, kuna mtu atajua moto wa Nairobi leo."

---

<strong>INT. ABANDONED FACTORY â€“ THE NEXT DAY</strong>

(The crew tracks the data to an abandoned factory. Inside, they move cautiously, guns drawn. The silence is suffocating, then suddenly, **gunshots ring out**.)

<strong>DREXX</strong>  
(Shouting)  
"Ambush! Tumeshikwa!"

(The crew dives for cover, firing back. Kamau moves like a shadow, taking down attackers one by one.)

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Yelling at Drexx)  
"Cover me! We need that main server."

---

<strong>INT. MAIN SERVER ROOM â€“ MOMENTS LATER</strong>

(Kamau reaches the server room, but itâ€™s a trap. Zuri stands there, a gun in her hand, smirking.)

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Stunned, raising his gun)  
"I knew it. Wewe ni traitor."

<strong>ZURI</strong>  
(Laughing softly)  
"I told you, trust is a weakness. But I never said you could trust me."

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(His voice hardening)  
"Hii game ends here."

(They both fire at the same time, but Zuri dodges and disappears into the shadows, leaving Kamau wounded but furious.)

---

<strong>INT. CYBER-LAIR â€“ NIGHT</strong>

(Back at the lair, the crew regroups. Kamau is injured, wrapping his arm as he explains what happened.)

<strong>SHANI</strong>  
(Bitterly)  
"So Zuri was just a setup from the beginning?"

<strong>DREXX</strong>  
(Grimly)  
"We trusted her, and she led us right into Bullâ€™s trap."

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
(Vengeful)  
"Na hiyo mistake lazima tulipe back. Bull wonâ€™t see whatâ€™s coming next."

---

<strong>EXT. ROOFTOP â€“ NIGHT</strong>

(Kamau stands alone on a Nairobi rooftop, looking over the city lights. His eyes are filled with anger and betrayal. He dials a number on his phone.)

<strong>KAMAU</strong>  
"Get everyone. Sasa hivi, weâ€™re going on the offensive. Tunaleta moto kwa mtaa."
